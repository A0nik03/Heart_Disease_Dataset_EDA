Heart Disease Dataset Analysis

This project is a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Heart Disease dataset, focusing on univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis techniques. The dataset helps in understanding patterns and insights into factors affecting heart disease.

We're exploring the Heart Disease dataset, which contains various attributes related to cardiovascular health, such as age, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate.

The analysis uses Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

ðŸ§  Summary of Insights

Univariate Analysis:

1. Distribution of age shows the majority of patients are between 50 and 60 years old.
   Patients with heart disease tend to have a higher median age compared to those without heart disease.

Bivariate Analysis:

2. Strong relationships observed between chest pain type and maximum heart rate.
   Patients with chest pain type 0 have the lowest median maximum heart rate.

3. Multivariate Analysis:

   A heatmap of correlations highlights significant relationships among variables, such as age, thalach (maximum heart rate), and cholesterol.

```python
# Hello, We're going to start working with Heart Disease Dataset, You can find it here:
# https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset/data


# Here are the arributes of the dataset:

# age
# sex
# chest pain type (4 values)
# resting blood pressure
# serum cholestoral in mg/dl
# fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
# resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
# maximum heart rate achieved
# exercise induced angina
# oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
# the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
# number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
# thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
# target: Presence of heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no).


# What you're to learn in this notebook:
# 1. How to load the dataset
# 2. How to explore the dataset
# 3. How to visualize the dataset

# Particularly, We will be seeing different techniques to analyze the dataset, including:
# Univariate Analysis
# Bivariate Analysis
# Multivariate Analysis


```

```python
# importing libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

```python
# Loading the dataset

df = pd.read_csv('C:\\Users\\nikrc\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Datasets\\heart.csv')
# TO show all columns in the dataset
pd.set_option('display.max_columns',None)

# Blocking the warnings
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')


df.head(10)

# 1. Univariate Analysis:
# Analysis of a single variable to understand its distribution and basic properties.
# 2. Bivariate Analysis:
# Bivariate analysis involves analyzing the relationship between two variables in the dataset.
# 3. Multivariate Analysis:
# Multivariate analysis involves analyzing the relationship between three or more variables in the dataset.

```

```python
# Before starting, Let's Divide the dataset into two parts:
# Numerical and Categorical features

# Numerical features
numerical_features = df.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64']).columns.tolist()
# Categorical features
categorical_features = df.select_dtypes(include=['object', 'category']).columns.tolist()

# Why is it important to separate numerical and categorical features?
# Because different analysis techniques are applied to numerical and categorical data.

# Different data types require different visualization techniques.

# This table would help you:

# | Data Type   | Visualization Technique |
# |-------------|-------------------------|
# | Numerical   | Histogram, Boxplot      |
# | Categorical | Bar Chart, Pie Chart    |
# | Time Series | Line Chart              |
# | Text        | Word Cloud, Bar Chart   |


# Let's now print the numerical and categorical features
print("Numerical Features:")

    Categorical Features:

```python
# As you can see, all the features in the dataset are numerical, but age,sex and target are categorical features.
# So, we will treat them as categorical features for the purpose of analysis.

# But it will be better to convert 'sex' column to categorical type and add another target column with 'Yes' and 'No'
# We're naming that Heart Disease

# What to observe from the above plot?
# We can see that there are more patients without heart disease (No) than with heart disease (Yes).

```python
# Let's Now Begin with Bivariate Analysis


# Bivariate Analysis
# Bivariate analysis involves analyzing the relationship between two variables in the dataset.

# Let's start with the relationship between age and target (heart disease)
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='Heart Disease', y='age', data=df, palette='Set2')
plt.title('Age vs Target (Heart Disease)')
plt.xlabel('Heart Disease')
plt.ylabel('Age')
plt.show()
```

```python
# We can se that the Individuals without heart disease tend to have a slightly higher median age compared to those with heart disease.
# also, the age distribution for individuals with heart disease is more spread out, indicating a wider range of ages.

```

```python
# Correlation Analysis

correlation = df['age'].corr(df['thalach'])
print(f"Correlation between Age and Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach): {correlation:.2f}")


# First we need to extract numerical values for correlation analysis
numerical_features = df.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64'])

# Correlation HeatMap
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(numerical_features.corr(), annot=True, cmap='rocket', linewidths=0.5)
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()
```

    Correlation between Age and Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach): -0.40

```python
# We can see that the highest correlation is between 'cp' (chest pain type) and 'target' (heart disease),
# followed by 'thalach' (maximum heart rate achieved) and 'target'.
```

# We can see that individuals with chest pain type 0 tend to have lower maximum heart rates achieved (thalach) compared to those with other chest pain types.
# This indicates that chest pain type 0 is associated with lower maximum heart rates, while chest pain types 1, 2, and 3 are associated with higher maximum heart rates.
```

```python
# This marks the end of our analysis on the Heart Disease Dataset.
# We have performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to understand the relationships between different variables in the dataset.
# We have also visualized the data using various plots to gain insights into the dataset.
# The analysis shows that age, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate achieved are important factors in determining the presence of heart disease.
